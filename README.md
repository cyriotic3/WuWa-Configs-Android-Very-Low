# NO LONGER MAINTAINED

Try not to ask me questions, I'm not that interested in doing configs for Android.

On newer Android versions you need to use Shizuku (or any other alternative) to access the data folder, won't write a guide for this so do a Google search about it.

Config location for Android:

![Android Config Location](https://i.imgur.com/LquUnoX.png)

---

Common folder contains:

`` UE4CommandLine.txt `` to skip intro videos

Copy the file to this location:

> /storage/emulated/0/Android/data/com.kurogame.wutheringwaves.global/files/UE4Game/Client/

---

Commands not included in config that might be useful:
```
Place commands in Engine.ini
Under [/Script/Engine.RendererSettings]

; Default value - 0
; Enable/disable landscape SSR
; Using this can remove shadows from grass
r.Mobile.EnableLandscapeSSR=1

; May improve Vulkan stability/performance
r.Vulkan.RobustBufferAccess=0
r.Vulkan.DescriptorSetLayoutMode=0

; 0: Disable | 1: Enable
; Lowers FPS to 30 when CPU temp over 65Â°C
r.Kuro.AutoCoolEnable=1
```
